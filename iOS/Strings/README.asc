= SimCity BuildIt! (iOS) - Strings

Scanning the link:{app}/SimCity[main executable] with `strings` reveals some anecdotal information. I've dumped the output link:SimCity.strings[here] and with some search and replace work, created a link:SimCity.strings.asc[ASCIIDoc formatted version] as well (beware, it's very large). I have also extracted some longer strings into separate files, which are all in this directory.

|Start |End |Title |Description

|`0x19bd64a` |`0x19bda08` |link:{find}19bd64a%20Jailbreak%20Detection.strings[**Jailbreak detection**] |Paths to check in order to determine if the device is jailbroken. Most of these paths are not writable in a rootless . Interestingly, the presence of the directories that I was able to create (in `/var/stash``) had no apparent effect on the game, even as I collected rewards and stuff.
|`0x19be22d` |`0x19be268` |link:{find}19be22d%20Privacy%20Laws.strings[**Privacy Laws**] |the strings `gdprApplies` alongside `hasConsent` and `ccpaApplies` alongside `ccpaOptOut` imply the the game has two different privacy policies. There's also `underAgeUser`.
|`0x19be29f` |`0x19be2ac` |link:Purchase%20Analytics.strings[**Purchase Analytics**] |There's two strings, `userLtvInUsd` (probably "user livetime value in US Dollars") and `lastPurchaseTimeInMs`
2+|`0x19be67c` |link:{find}19be67c%20Secrets.strings[Potential Key] |A 51 character string which is probably a key of some sort.
|`0x19be6d4` |`0x19bf9ac` |link:{find}19bf9ac%20HTTP.string[HTTP Implementation] |A huge lot of strings related to HTTP.
