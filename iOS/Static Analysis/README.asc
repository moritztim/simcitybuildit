= Proper Static Analysis
Once I got bored of manually looking through strings found in the binary, I moved on to proper static analysis with Ghidra.

== Read Hearing: EA Account Authentication

After spending some time searching for things like `decrypt`, `privateKey`, etc. I eventually stumbled upon something that surprised me: A format string refering to a private key. Here it is:
```
"%s  privateKey: \"%s\",\n"
```
I went ahead and got ChatGPT involved and they were like "Logging or formatting debug/info output [...] including a private key string (hopefully not in production!)"

I tracked down the function that was using this format string and after some back and forth with the AI I realized that it must be related to the EA account authentication, which I later confirmed by looking at the `strings` output again.

It's very interesting that they're logging the private key of the EA account, but it's not what I'm after, however, it gives me hope that there's more stupid manoeuvres like this in the code, potentially leading to more sensitive information.
