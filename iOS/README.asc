= SimCity BuildIt! (iOS) - File Analysis
It's all encrypted :(

== Detect-it-Easy (DiE) Report

I have scanned the files using https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy. The raw output (with the paths modified to reflect the iOS internal paths) is in the file link:report.txt[report.txt].

== File Overview

Based on the DiE report, I have created a link:files.csv[`CSV` Table] with all the information the report has found, along with file metadata and additional information I have learned.

== Game Files

=== Encryption

Most of the game files are stored in binary files with the extension `.group.bin`. With an entropy between `7.5` and `8.0`, they're clearly encrypted.

Some 45 of the `.group.bin` files are detected by DiE as containing deflate compressed files (`Archive: Archive: Raw Deflate stream[@1Dh]`, where `@1Dh` is the offset), however, I have to assume these are false positives as their entropy is no different and I wasn't able to extract any data from them.

=== Assets

Most Assets are among those encrypted `.group.bin` files.

==== Images

A few images are stored in `.jpg` or `.png` files. Some of them are unencrypted while others have valid headers but encrypted content.

.3 unencrypted images in `textures/`:

==== Sounds

Game Sounds are stored in another `.group.bin` file located in link:{app}/audio/[`audio/`] along with a corresponding link:{app}/audio/sound_xml.group.bin[`sound_xml.group.bin`] file.

The tutorial music however is stored in an unencrypted lonesome Ogg file in the music subdirectory named link:{app}/music/music_tutorial.ogg[music_tutorial.ogg]. It is indeed the music that plays during the tutorial.

==== Icons

.There is one unencrypted link:{app}/Frameworks/HelpshiftX.framework/Assets.car[`Assets.car`] with 5 `pdf` files containing gray button icons:
