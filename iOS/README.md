# Detect-it-Easy (DiE) Report
I have scanned the files using [Detect-it-Easy (DiE)](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy).

The raw output (with the paths modified to reflect the iOS internal paths) is in the file [report.txt](report.txt)

# File Information
Based on the DiE report, I have created a CSV file with all the information the report has found and additional information I have learned.
